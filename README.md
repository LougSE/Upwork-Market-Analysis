# Upwork Market Data Analysis for Optimized Profile

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Upwork job listings to understand market trends and optimize my Upwork profile for better success rates. By using data extraction techniques and visualization tools, the project provides valuable insights into job market demands, helping to tailor proposals and strategies more effectively.

## Background
After investing over $200 in connects on Upwork with little success, I realized that the first two lines of a proposal are crucial as they are the only part clients initially see. To better align my profile with client expectations, I created this project to analyze the job market and adjust my profile accordingly.

## Objectives
- Analyze Upwork job listings to identify market trends and demands.
- Extract job-specific data such as titles, skills, qualifications, and hourly rates.
- Use data visualization tools to uncover patterns and inform profile optimization strategies.

## Project Phases

### 1. Data Collection
- **Frequency**: RSS feed job listings are collected every two days.
- **Automation**: A Python script automates the download and conversion of RSS feeds into JSON format.
- **Storage**: JSON files are organized into a structured folder system for ease of use.

### 2. Data Transformation (ETL Process)
- **Extraction**: Job data is extracted using natural language processing (NLP) and tools like ChatGPT API, Kor, and LangChain.
- **Transformation**: Data is formatted to include key job details such as title, responsibilities, skills, and qualifications.
- **Loading**: The data is stored in a database or file system for analysis.

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Tool**: Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards.
- **Insights**: 
  - Job titles and responsibilities
  - Required skills and qualifications
  - Hourly range and country of listing
  - Trends over time and emerging market needs
