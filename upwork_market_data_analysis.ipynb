    "## Little Story\n",
    "I recently started on Upwork and invested over $200 in connects, but I wasn't seeing any success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determined to figure out why, I realized that being new to the platform and lacking badges was a factor, but there wasn't much I could do about that, since I'm just stating. I then thought my proposals might be the issue and tried to improve them, but still had no luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s when I decided to create a client account to get an insider’s perspective. By posting a job, I noticed something crucial: the first two lines of a proposal are vital. Clients see a list of proposals with only the first two lines visible, so these lines need to be a compelling hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this insight, I wondered if perhaps my profile wasn’t aligned with current market demands. This led me to undertake a market data analysis on Upwork. I began by gathering months' worth of RSS files containing job listings to understand better what clients are looking for today."
