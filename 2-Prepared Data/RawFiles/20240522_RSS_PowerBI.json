The TV will be mounted in PORTRAIT orientation.<br /><br />\n__________<br />\nRequirements:<br /><br />\nData Source: All data is contained in a single Google Sheet, which updates nightly around midnight.<br /><br />\nDisplay: The dashboard should display the data in an easily digestible manner and be available via a web link. It will run continuously on a Raspberry Pi and be visible 24/7 on the production floor.<br /><br />\nUser Interaction: The dashboard should be designed for passive viewing, requiring no interaction from the team.<br /><br />\nData Updates: The dashboard must always display the most recent data from the Google Sheet, which updates daily and sometimes more frequently.<br /><br />\nData Quantity: My sample data displays approximately 6 customer orders, with 21 products ordered. However, we will often have up to 15 customer orders, with 40 products ordered.
