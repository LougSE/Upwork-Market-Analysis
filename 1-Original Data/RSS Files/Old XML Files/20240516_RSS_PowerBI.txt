I provide you below with a broad generic description of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;If interested,&nbsp;&nbsp;please feel free to reach me for more detailed questions.<br /><br />
Project Overview:<br />
Develop a dashboard for an internal tool within a diverse organizational context. The dashboard will display monthly performance across several distinct organizational areas. It will provide aggregated visualizations to track performance against fixed set targets using various charts (barplot, donut, timeline), summary tables, maps, and interactive elements such data drills and slicers. The primary audience will be project managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualizations might include aggregated numerical tables, some maps and other easy to interpret visualizations (timelines, barplots and donut charts) with drill menus and a timeline slicer by months (with cumulative figures functionality). The audience is mostly project managers so no need for very complicated visuals. The dashboard will very likely include 3 separate sheets<br /><br />
Technical Requirements:<br /><br />
- The data source will be a unique Excel workbook with several sheets for each organizational unit<br />
- You will not need to deal with the Excel itself, as it is already prepared to collect the data in a clean way using many internal validations and dropdowns to ensure that the data feeded to PowerBi is as clean as possible<br />
- Initial query connections and data wrangling will be done to provide a combined dataset for easy filtering, as a starting point.<br />
- The PowerBi .pbix and Excel data source file will be hosted on the same SharePoint folder for seamless connection<br />
- Each of the organizational units excel sheets have identical column names across areas, with variations in some specific indicator categories depending on the organizational unit.<br />
- Data will usually be aggregated at subnational level1 and second subnational level2. Entities have standardized names to facilitate PowerBI mapping capabilities. Map visualizations will be either bubble maps or choropleth.<br />
- Draft wireframes with suggested visuals and tables will be provided to guide the development process<br />
- Guidance and feedback will be provided through the phases to facilitate the specialist work.<br />
- More details on the project will be provided to preselected candidates in order to better frame the scope<br /><br />
I look forward to collaborating with a skilled specialist to create the basis for an effective and user-friendly dashboard within the suggested timeframe and budget.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $2,000
