We have a function stored on our Azure platform that is connected to a SQL Server table that holds a unique url that when entered into a browser changes another value on the same table to show that record has been seen and actioned by the user.<br /><br />
We need to be able to trigger this url in a PowerBi table so we can update the tracking value in our table.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that by default PowerBi opens a browser window.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />
We need someone to help us overcome this so when the your is selected the value changes without opening a browser. We are happy to use Power Automate to achieve this, but need a detailed answer on what it requires us to do.<br /><br />
We can send over the PBIX file upon initial messaging.<br /><br />

for Tyre Retailer and Mechanical Service business.<br /><br />
Looking to create a data visualization dashboard to easily glean a quick overview of important business KPIs using charts and pivot tables.<br />
Looking for a Data Analysist who can help transform lots of data points into useful data visualization and so my client can quickly understand&nbsp;&nbsp;and interpret important business KPIs. Ideally you would have done this before with a similar business.<br />
What I have in mind is a combination of charts and pivot table to give a quick overview of how the business is tracking in terms of sales revenue. Understand what is currently in demand and identify top sellers as well as keeping track of COGS, Source of business, Gross Profit, marketing channels, Average Transaction Value (ATV) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).<br />
We receive an email with a CSV file from our CRM and the end of each business day, which has all the details of the transactions for that business day. <br />
The CSV files are then transferred and stored in a Dropbox folder rather than using Google&rsquo;s platform.<br /><br />
Wondering if all this can be done just using Excel or it is better to use Power BI for a more user-friendly experience for my client.<br />
Also wondering if it can collect phone tracking CSVs from our Google Ads account and correlate phone numbers from Google Ads tracking with phone numbers from our CRM so we can see which customers actually ended up buying and how much they spent. Point of sale is via phone calls and Google Phone tracking CSVs from each campaign are also downloaded to a Dropbox Folder<br /><br />
Fetching data from Dropbox data sources containing CSV files .<br />
&bull;	Can Excel or Power BI be setup to automatically fetch data on a daily basis whenever a new CSV file enters the folder?<br />

This opportunity requires Philosophical Creativity in combination with a desire to dive deep into the theory behind our vision, to help us to reason through and design complex formulas.<br />
The ideal candidate will become a long- term consultant, helping us define and build the reports necessary to provide transparency on the health of the progression of each of our projects, as well as the individual (and collective) contribution performance of the staff, including technicians and administrative team members, to ultimately visualize these and other organizational KPI&#039;s.<br />
We have been developing on the Microsoft Power Platform for several years. Consequently, we have created many fields/ columns of custom data that we need to turn into performance visualizations. This will require initially gaining an understanding of what we currently have, and what the intention is/was behind each customization. We will then work together on defining, articulating and refining our theory, formulas and business processes. Ww have already developed both SSRS reports and Power BI reports, but still need to dive much deeper into the weeds to achieve our vision. <br />
We will continue to identify and add new data points as we see fit. <br />
Don&#039;t let not being experienced with Power BI or SSRS deter you from responding, providing you really feel a connection to this opportunity.<br />
