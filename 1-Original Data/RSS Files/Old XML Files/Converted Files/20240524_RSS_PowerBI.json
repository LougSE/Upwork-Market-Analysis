I have attempted to do this myself with the pre-built connectors but I do not think they work now, hence I need to develop a bespoke solution. <br />\nI am thinking that this solution can be built using demo account data from Hubspot to begin with, and then you can show me how to replace the demo account credentials with my actual Hubspot credentials. <br />\nMy end goal for this is to have my Azure SQL database connected to Power BI (already achieved) to build custom visualisations. I just need the connection built. <br />\nIf you think there is a better way to do this, then I am open to other suggestions. <br />\nFinally, there is plenty of scope with this piece should the job be completed in a satisfactory manner. My business has a requirement to build many connectors into our Azure environment in the near future. <br />\nThank you, <br />\nNick<br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: May 24, 2024 06:00 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Data Engineering<br /><b>Skills</b>:Python,     Apache Airflow,     SQL,     Apache Superset,     Databricks Platform,     BigQuery,     Snowflake,     Google Cloud Platform,     Microsoft Power BI,     Microsoft SQL Server,     API Integration,     Microsoft Azure,     Data Warehousing &amp; ETL Software,     PostgreSQL    \n<br /><b>Skills</b>:        Python,                     Apache Airflow,                     SQL,                     Apache Superset,                     Databricks Platform,                     BigQuery,                     Snowflake,                     Google Cloud Platform,                     Microsoft Power BI,                     Microsoft SQL Server,                     API Integration,                     Microsoft Azure,                     Data Warehousing &amp; ETL Software,                     PostgreSQL            <br /><b>Country</b>: Australia\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Title-Azure-Data-Factory-API-Connection-Build-Hubspot_%7E010770019046a0a351?source=rss\">click to apply</a>",
