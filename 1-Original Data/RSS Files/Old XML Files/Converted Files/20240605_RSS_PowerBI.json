Please let me know if it is possible. <br /><br />\nHere is the plan ChatGPT gave me as an example:<br />\nAutomating the process of tracking job postings from competitor recruitment websites involves several steps, each of which can be streamlined using AI and automation tools. Below is a comprehensive plan to automate this workflow:<br /><br />\n### Step 1: Web Scraping<br />\n#### Tools: <br />\n- **Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy**<br />\n- **Automation platforms like UiPath or Selenium**<br /><br />\n**Action:**<br />\n1. **Web Scraping Setup:** Create a web scraper to automatically extract job descriptions from your competitor&#039;s websites.<br />\n2. **Frequency:** Schedule the scraper to run daily or weekly, depending on the frequency of job posting updates.<br /><br />\n### Step 2: Text Extraction and Processing<br />\n#### Tools:<br />\n- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries like NLTK or spaCy**<br />\n- **Google Cloud Natural Language API**<br /><br />\n**Action:**<br />\n1. **Extract Job Descriptions:** Parse the scraped web data to extract relevant job descriptions.<br />\n2. **NLP Processing:** Use NLP techniques to clean and structure the job descriptions.<br /><br />\n### Step 3: Search for Original Postings<br />\n#### Tools:<br />\n- **Google Search API**<br />\n- **Custom Search JSON API**<br /><br />\n**Action:**<br />\n1. **Automated Search Queries:** Use the extracted job descriptions to automate Google search queries.<br />\n2. **Result Analysis:** Extract and analyze the top search results to identify the original job postings.<br /><br />\n### Step 4: Data Extraction from Original Postings<br />\n#### Tools:<br />\n- **BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for Web Scraping**<br />\n- **NLP Tools for Data Extraction**<br /><br />\n**Action:**<br />\n1. **Identify Client Names:** Scrape and extract client names and other relevant details from the original job postings.<br /><br />\n### Step 5: Data Storage and Management<br />\n#### Tools:<br />\n- **Google Sheets API**<br />\n- **Database Systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL)**<br /><br />\n**Action:**<br />\n1. **Automate Data Entry:** Use the Google Sheets API to automatically input the extracted data into your tracking spreadsheet.<br />\n2. **Database Option:** Alternatively, store the data in a structured database for better management and querying.<br /><br />\n### Step 6: Monitoring and Reporting<br />\n#### Tools:<br />\n- **Google Sheets/Excel for Reporting**<br />\n- **BI Tools like Tableau or Power BI**<br /><br />\n**Action:**<br />\n1. **Automate Reports:** Create automated reports and dashboards to visualize and track the extracted client information and analyze trends over time.<br />\n2. **Alerts and Notifications:** Set up automated alerts for new client data entries or significant changes.<br /><br />\n### Detailed Implementation Steps:<br /><br />\n1. **Web Scraping Implementation:**<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```python<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import requests<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from bs4 import BeautifulSoup<br /><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def scrape_jobs(competitor_url):<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response = requests.get(competitor_url)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, &#039;html.parser&#039;)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs = soup.find_all(&#039;div&#039;, class_=&#039;job-description&#039;)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job_descriptions = [job.get_text() for job in jobs]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return job_descriptions<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br /><br />\n2. **Automated Google Search:**<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```python<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from googleapiclient.discovery import build<br /><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def google_search(query, api_key, cse_id):<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service = build(&amp;quot;customsearch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;v1&amp;quot;, developerKey=api_key)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;res = service.cse().list(q=query, cx=cse_id).execute()<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return res[&#039;items&#039;]<br /><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job_desc = &amp;quot;Sample job description&amp;quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;search_results = google_search(job_desc, &#039;your_api_key&#039;, &#039;your_cse_id&#039;)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br /><br />\n3. **Data Entry to Google Sheets:**<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```python<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import gspread<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials<br /><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def update_google_sheet(data):<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scope = [&amp;quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds&amp;quot;, &#039;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&#039;]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(&#039;path_to_creds.json&#039;, scope)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;client = gspread.authorize(creds)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheet = client.open(&amp;quot;Client Tracker&amp;quot;).sheet1<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheet.append_row(data)<br /><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update_google_sheet([&amp;quot;Client Name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Job Description&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;])<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br /><br />\n4. **Scheduling and Automation:**<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scheduling:** Use cron jobs or Windows Task Scheduler to run your scripts at regular intervals.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Automation Tools:** Consider using tools like UiPath or Zapier to handle parts of the automation that require interaction with web interfaces.<br /><br />\n### Final Thoughts<br />\nAutomating this process will save significant time and effort, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks.

/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials<br /><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def update_google_sheet(data):<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scope = [&amp;quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds&amp;quot;, &#039;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&#039;]<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(&#039;path_to_creds.json&#039;, scope)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;client = gspread.authorize(creds)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheet = client.open(&amp;quot;Client Tracker&amp;quot;).sheet1<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheet.append_row(data)<br /><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update_google_sheet([&amp;quot;Client Name&amp;quot;,
