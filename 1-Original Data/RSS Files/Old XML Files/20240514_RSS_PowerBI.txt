YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN NEW YORK TIME ZONE!!!<br />
BE FLUENT IN ENGLISH!!!<br />
Type: Remote | Full-time<br /><br />
Job Description:<br /><br />
Language Requirements:<br />
Fluent in English<br /><br />
About You<br />
â— You are a hands-on expert in system integration, data warehousing (or at least ETL specification and development), and reporting.<br />
â— You are experienced at team leadership: assigning work, managing delivery, and addressing risks and issues. Initially, you will have only two people to share tasks with. But, the team will grow as our customer<br /><br />
Responsibilities<br />
Customer Onboarding<br />
â— You will work alongside and in lock step with Sales, Product and Customer Success directly with customers during the onboarding of new customers on the company SaaS platform.<br />
â— You will define and implement processes that enable you to collect customer-specific implementation requirements and configurations and oversee smooth implementation for each customer.<br />
â— Working with the Customer Success Team, you will determine how the customer plans to use the company&rsquo;s system and the data that the customer will supply. You will rely on your strong communication and interpersonal skills to build relationships and ensure everyone is aligned.<br />
â— Reporting<br />
â—‹ You will work with customers to understand reporting requirements and recommend visualizations.<br />
â— Customer Data Integration<br />
â—‹ You will work with the customer to specify and implement client data integrations through third party APIs or flat file feeds.<br />
â—‹ You will define and oversee the specification and development of ETL required to populate our application for each customer.<br />
â—‹ You will specify customer-specific data model changes required to support reporting requirements and oversee the implementation of these changes.<br />
â—‹ You will specify and oversee the implementation of any customizations to our platform required to allow us to comply with our customers&rsquo; information security and compliance requirements.<br />
â—‹ You will oversee implementation of SSO connectivity between the company and customer systems<br />
Human Resource Capacity Planning<br />
â— You will develop and manage a capacity plan for your support team and formulate a staff management plan to support projected customer launches. (The data for this planning can come from our issue tracking system where we track time and from the insights you gain from managing customer implementations. Ideally, we can largely automate this capacity planning process.)<br />
Customer Technical Support<br />
â— You and your team will provide the customer ongoing support, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring optimal platform functioning and performance.<br />
â— You will track and manage all customer technical issues through to successful resolution and communicate proactively with the customer. You will implement fixes and configurations yourself or project manage engineers who do it for you.<br />
Product Development Support<br />
â— You will work closely with our Product and Core Software Development Teams to champion the delivery of product and platform capabilities, features, and functions that improve the customer experience.<br />
â— You will ensure that customers&rsquo; needs are prioritized and that the customers&rsquo; voices are heard throughout the product development process.<br /><br />
A Few Things We&rsquo;re Looking For<br />
â— Experience building a startup company from 0 to 1: we are going to need you to lead and establish and evolve processes<br />
â— Experience team leading or project managing technical delivery; you are going to be a developer who is delegating to other developers.<br />
â— Data Warehousing, data modeling, and ETL<br />
â— Knowledge of the best ways to visualize data to answer questions and solve problems<br />
â— Experience with enterprise BI tools such as Tableau and Power BI<br />
â— Expertise in NodeJS, Typescript, JavaScript &ndash; that&rsquo;s what our ETL is currently developed in though we could be convinced to switch technologies.<br />
â— Exceptional common sense and the ability to manage ambiguity<br /><br />
Bonus<br />
Experience in any of these areas is a bonus:<br />
â— Building or using Financial Planning &amp;amp; Analysis systems<br />
â— Global, enterprise SaaS development<br />
â— ReactJS<br /><br />
Diverse Perspectives<br />
We know that innovation thrives on teams where diverse points of view come together to solve hard problems in ways that are just now possible. As such, we explicitly seek people that bring diverse life experiences, diverse educational backgrounds, diverse cultures, and diverse work experiences. Please, be prepared to share with us how your perspective will bring something unique and valuable to our team as grows.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $15.00-$35.00
