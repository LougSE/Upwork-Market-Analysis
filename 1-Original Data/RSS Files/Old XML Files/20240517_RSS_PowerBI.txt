We are seeking an experienced SQL and ETL specialist to assist us in automating the data extraction and transformation process for Power BI reporting. We have software where users can create their own forms. The data from these forms is stored in various tables within a SQL database.<br /><br />
Currently, manually crafting queries and merging these tables to generate usable reports in Power BI is a complex process. We aim to automate and simplify this process so that dynamic forms can be easily and directly converted into a usable format for Power BI.<br /><br />
Project Requirements:<br /><br />
1. Analysis of Current Data Structure:<br />
Understand and document the current database structure and data relationships.<br /><br />
2. Dynamic SQL View Creation:<br />
Develop a stored procedure that creates dynamic views based on available forms and fields.<br />
These views should automatically select and present the correct columns in a flat format suitable for Power BI.<br /><br />
3. ETL Pipeline Development:<br />
Develop an ETL pipeline (preferably in Python) that periodically extracts, transforms, and loads the data into a reporting table in the database.<br />
This pipeline must be flexible enough to automatically detect and process new forms and fields.<br /><br />
4. Documentation and Handover:<br />
Provide comprehensive documentation of the developed system, including instructions for adding new forms and maintaining the system.<br />
Transfer knowledge and code to our internal team to enable them to perform maintenance and make any necessary adjustments.<br /><br />
Required Skills:<br />
- Extensive experience with SQL and relational databases.<br />
- Experience developing dynamic SQL queries and views.<br />
- Knowledge of ETL processes and tools.<br />
- Experience in data modeling and transformation for reporting purposes, especially for Power BI.<br />
- Strong documentation skills and the ability to transfer knowledge to an internal team.<br /><br />
Project Type:<br />

I hope this message finds you well. I have an important task that requires your expertise, and I would greatly appreciate your guidance on completing it.<br /><br />
Available Tools and Software: <br />
To help you provide the best possible solution, here are the tools and software we have on our PCs for this task:<br />
&bull;	Word/ Excel / Power BI / Power Automate / Power Query / Microsoft Lists / Outlook / SharePoint / OneDrive<br /><br />
Background: <br />
Within our company, there are 10 departments. Each department produces daily reports with a significant amount of data. These reports are sent daily via Outlook to Department A, which is responsible for collecting and storing them in PC memory, OneDrive, and SharePoint. Each department has its own folder, named by the department&rsquo;s name, where their daily reports are saved.<br /><br />
Your Task:<br />
&bull;	Create an example dashboard (proof of concept) and prepare a step-by-step guideline for company employees who will be responsible for preparing these dashboards in the future.<br />
&bull;	Ensure the guideline is easy to follow for employees with begginers/intermediate knowledge of computers, Windows, and Microsoft applications.<br /><br />
Company Objective: <br />
We aim to prepare individual dashboards for each department using data from their daily reports. Each dashboard should:<br />
&bull;	Include data from all the daily reports for the department since the beginning of 2024.<br />
&bull;	Allow us to select and display reports from specific dates.<br />
&bull;	Enable easy switching between dates within the same dashboard.<br />
&bull;	Visually present the data in tables, charts, columns, and lines.<br /><br />
Company Future Automation Goal: <br />
In the future, we want the following to be possible:<br />
&bull;	Automatically save incoming daily reports from Outlook to SharePoint or OneDrive.<br />
&bull;	Automatically update the respective department&rsquo;s Power BI dashboard with new reports from SharePoint/OneDrive.<br />
&bull;	Ensure immediate access to today&#039;s current report (the latest report from SharePoint/OneDrive) upon opening the Power BI link for the department&#039;s dashboard.<br />
&bull;	Provide immediate access to view and select data from any date, past or present.<br /><br />
Next Steps: <br />
If you need more details about the structure of the daily reports and the specific data to be presented on the dashboards, please let me know. I can provide an example report and explain the necessary data. We can discuss these details further once you confirm your capability to handle this task.<br /><br />
Request for Confirmation: <br />
Please confirm if you are capable of completing this task and providing us with a tutorial for future reference. If you agree, I will send you an example table and images to help you prepare.<br />
If you are able to complete this task and provide a clear tutorial for future use, I will undoubtedly give you a 5-star rating. Payment will be smooth and prompt.<br /><br />
I look forward to your response and to working with you on this project.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: May 17, 2024 09:20 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Data Visualization<br /><b>Skills</b>:Microsoft Power BI,     Data Visualization,     Data Analysis,     Microsoft Excel,     Microsoft Power Automate
