I do want easily readable, explorable, and filterable <br />\n3. I need to look for clever ways so I don&#039;t need to maintain tons of different reports for different users.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example if all the data is the same,&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to have the login for Unit 1, show Unit 1 data,&nbsp;&nbsp;for Unit 2 show Unit 2 data. <br />\n4. Good at communications <br />\n5. I REALLY need good alerting to SMS, Telegram and WhatsApp. <br />\n6. Someone who gives good advice based on experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;If its a dumb idea, say something. <br /><br />\nI work with our dev team for years so its not huge work, but it will grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially it will be us sitting online together pulling together some basic views. <br />\n7. Ideally someone who can work in the mornings EST or evenings EST. <br />\n8. WhatsApp, or Signal user.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am global and travelling so easy communications is key. <br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: August 12, 2024 14:17 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Data Visualization<br /><b>Skills</b>:Dashboard,     API Integration,     Grafana,     Data Visualization    \n<br /><b>Skills</b>:        Dashboard,                     API Integration,                     Grafana,                     Data Visualization            <br /><b>Country</b>: United States\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Grafana-Expert-Configuration-Data-Linking-Data-Visualization-with-Grafana-Advisory_%7E014673c36d22df4a54?source=rss\">click to apply</a>",
